## Building and running the app with Docker Compose
This template comes with a Docker Compose configuration file that can be used to build and run the app inside a Docker container. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Build the Docker image using docker compose build.
2. Start the container using `docker compose up` (or) `docker compose up -d` to start the container in the background.
3. Since the docker-compose file uses volumes, local changes (during development) in the project directory will be reflected in the docker container.
